# TurntableBot

[Alain Gilbert](https://github.com/alaingilbert) has done a lot of work developing the [Turntable-API](https://github.com/alaingilbert/Turntable-API) and has ported his node.js code over to Ruby, which is great.  The problem that I found though is that the Ruby port doesn't feel like Ruby.  I took it upon myself to change this.

This is my first real Ruby project, so don't expect greatness.

## Usage

This library creates a simple DSL that can be used for creating bots quickly.  Here is an example that allows members of the room to tell your bot to 'Awesome' a song.

```ruby
require_relative "./lib/turntablebot"
require "yaml"
config = YAML::load(File.open('config.yml'))


TurntableBot.create do
  as_user         config['user']
  authorized_by   config['auth']
  in_room         config['room']

  on :speak do |message|
    if message.text =~ /\/bop/i
      vote :up
    end
  end
end
```
